              <span>Hi Martin :))! Just wanted to say how much i appreciate you and care for you. When we first met, i was at one my lowest, and meeting you and talking to you really gave me hope for the other side. On who I could become. It gave me so much clarity that I just simply had to do better, that there was no other way out of the miserable hole I dug for myself. You brought calmness and serenity where only agitation, noise and intensity resided in me. Just being in your company made me see the bigger picture, and made me a better person for myself and therefore for other people. I will be eternally grateful to you for that. Being with you has really stabilized my life because that's really what you bring, you bring peace and balance. I hope that doesn't sound like I am with you just to feel okay, what I meant is that you helped me, whether you meant to or not. You're so caring and understanding, you're fun!!!!, you're smart and resourceful, you're curious and ambitious, you're hot :3. You really are so good for me and I hope I, in return, am good for you as well. Thank you for giving me space in your life, thank you for being there for me mwah:3 You truly bring me so much joy! I am so lucky to have you:3 I wish to have the privelege to keep getting to know you :)! Mwah!!<br> Happy Valentine's Day love!!!:33</span>
